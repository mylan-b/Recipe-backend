# Solution Document

This document provides a technical overview of the Recipe Backend Application, including the architecture design, trade-offs, security and monitoring considerations, and cost management strategies.

## 1. Architecture Overview

The architecture of this application follows Clean Architecture principles, ensuring a clear separation of concerns across different layers:

### Layers:

1. **Recipe.API**
    - The entry point for handling HTTP requests.
    - Includes middleware, dependency injection setup, and request-response processing.
    - Exposes endpoints following RESTful conventions.
    - Includes Swagger for API documentation.

2. **Recipe.Application**
    - Contains application services, commands, and queries (CQRS pattern if applied).
    - Enforces business workflows while interacting with domain models.
    - Implements interfaces defined in the Domain layer.

3. **Recipe.Domain**
    - The core of the application, containing:
        - Domain entities.
        - Value objects.
        - Aggregates.
        - Domain events and basic validations.
    - Purely business-focused and agnostic of external concerns.

4. **Recipe.Infrastructure**
    - Handles external concerns such as database access, API integrations, and file or caching systems.
    - Contains the implementation for repositories, persistence, and any third-party service clients.

5. **Recipe.Tests**
    - Includes unit tests for the Domain and Application layers.
    - Integration testing for the Infrastructure and API endpoints.
    - Helps verify the end-to-end behavior of the system.

The architecture is designed to ensure:
- **Separation of Concerns:** Each layer has a specific responsibility.
- **Testability:** Core logic is framework-agnostic, allowing focused testing.
- **Flexibility:** Changes in external dependencies (databases, third-party services) can be achieved with minimal impact on other layers.

## 2. Trade-offs

While implementing the architecture, certain trade-offs had to be addressed:

### Pros:
- **Scalability:** Clean architecture ensures scalability by decoupling components.
- **Maintainability:** Clear separation of roles allows quick debugging and modifications.
- **Flexibility:** Easy to swap or upgrade dependencies or frameworks in the Infrastructure layer.

### Cons:
- **Complexity for Small Projects:** The layered design may seem too heavyweight for smaller applications.
- **Initial Overhead:** Setting up interfaces, abstractions, and domain modeling requires additional effort initially.
- **Performance Cost:** Dependency injection and layered processing might introduce slight overhead. However, proper caching mechanisms can mitigate this.

## 3. Security and Monitoring Notes

### Security Considerations:
1. **Authentication and Authorization:**
    - Implemented using JWT token-based authentication.
    - Role-based access control (RBAC) ensures users can only access what they’re authorized for.

2. **Data Validation:**
    - Input data is validated at the API level to prevent injection attacks.
    - The Domain enforces business rules with additional safeguards.

3. **Protection Against Common Vulnerabilities:**
    - SQL Injection: Using parameterized queries via ORMs like EF Core.
    - Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): Sanitizing user inputs and escaping HTML content.
    - CSRF Protection: Enforced through secure cookies and anti-CSRF tokens.
    - Logging Sensitive Data: Logs are sanitized to avoid leaking user or system secrets.

4. **Secure Communication:**
    - All communication is encrypted using HTTPS.
    - TLS certificates are mandated for production environments.

### Monitoring and Observability:
1. **Centralized Logging:**
    - Logs are captured using a structured format (e.g., JSON) and sent to a centralized log aggregator (e.g., Seq, ELK stack).

2. **Health Checks:**
    - API endpoints expose health check routes for liveness and readiness probes.

3. **Performance Monitoring:**
    - Metrics, such as request latency, throughput, and error rates, are captured using tools like Prometheus or Application Insights.

4. **Alerting:**
    - Integrated with monitoring platforms (e.g., Grafana, PagerDuty) to notify the team of anomalies or outages.

## 4. Cost Strategies

Here are strategies to optimize cost while running the application:

### 1. **Infrastructure Optimization:**
- **Hosting:** Use cloud providers like Azure or AWS with a pay-as-you-go model to avoid unnecessary expenses for idle resources.
- **Scaling:**
    - Start with minimal instances in production and scale horizontally (add instances) as demand grows.
    - Consider serverless technologies (e.g., Azure Functions, AWS Lambda) for low-traffic endpoints.

### 2. **Storage Costs:**
- Use a relational database with built-in scalability like PostgreSQL or SQL Server.
- Employ automated backup policies with lifecycle rules to archive or delete old backups.
- Compress log and telemetry data before archiving.

### 3. **Traffic Optimization:**
- Use caching (e.g., Redis) at the API and database levels to reduce computational overhead.
- Implement a Content Delivery Network (CDN) for serving static assets, reducing bandwidth costs.

### 4. **Monitoring Costs:**
- Avoid storing excessive logs indefinitely. Set up log retention and archival policies based on business requirements.
- Use free tiers or cost-effective monitoring plans for observability tools.

### 5. **Development Efficiency:**
- Automate DevOps pipelines to build, test, and deploy applications efficiently.
- Use code quality tools to reduce debugging time and improve team productivity.
